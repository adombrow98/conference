            <p>Alison is a plant enthusiast and animal lover. She learned a lot
                of what she knows from her college professor who got her interested
                in botany and how plants can benefit people. She enjoys gardening and
                house plants as well. She finds it interesting the various ways plants
                can be used to cure ailments, cause problems, or improve mental health.
                The one biggest thing that she did not realize at first is how important
                fungi are and that they have so many different possible uses. A lot of
                her interest lies in mental health improvement and cures for diseases
                such as cancer.
