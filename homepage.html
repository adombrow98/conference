            <p>New scientific discoveries are being made daily. Making it easier for one to 
                live longer and be healthier. Oddly enough, a lot of discoveries often come
                from nature itself and learning how to use it. That is why this conference
                is focused on the botanist side of science and learning about how everyday
                plants could benefit everyone in the long run. By studying this we could 
                learn various ways to treat illness that does not rely on testy chemicals
                or otherwise harmful materials. This years conference takes place on the 29th 
                July at the Greater Richmond Convention Center.
